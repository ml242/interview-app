## Hello Ubiquiti!

Here is the code for the take home assignment running at [Interview App](https://interview-app.pages.dev/)

Please feel free to pull this repo and to run it on your local devices as well.

```
   git clone git@github.com:ml242/interview-app.git
   npm i
   npm run dev
```

It was a fun assignment with a lot to explore. As it was also pretty open ended for the instructions I have made the biggest impact I could with my NN hours.

1. All of the logic is done for filtering, searching, etc.

2. The markup is complete while also being somewhat mobile friendly (which was neglected on the Figma)

3. The technologies I have used are Vite and Tailwind as both of them "get out of your way" and would be easy for the team taking the handoff to incorporate more specific UI libraries for theming, icons, or if there were additional needs like SSR.

This decision was guided by the instructions - it was hinted that this app is more of an internal tool than a public facing application, although I'd be happy to explore it more with more time to add the drop shadows and graphics.

**Hope you enjoy, I look forward to hearing from you.**

Matt
